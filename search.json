    "section": "",
    "text": "It’s been five years since the marriage between the Minnesota Vikings and Kirk Cousins started. The question this offseason with trade rumors and no extension given to Cousins is whether it’s time to move on. I decided to find out myself if it was worth it to move on from Cousins using data of his last three seasons compared to the league. With this first graph I took at touchdowns to interceptions the last three years. The longer the line on the graph, the better it is. As the graph shows he is top 5 in passing touchdowns and limits the turnovers well. This looks like a quarterback that could win you a Superbowl with the right weapons. He’s up there with some of the best quarterbacks in the league such as Patrick Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers and Josh Allen. The problem I noticed when looking at all the data is that when you start looking at the advanced stats that’s when it starts to change.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\ndefense20 <- read_csv(\"2020NFLDefensiveStats.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2020)\ndefense21 <- read_csv(\"2021NFLDefensiveStats.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2021)\ndefense22 <- read_csv(\"2022DefensiveStats.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2022)\n\ndefense <- bind_rows(defense20, defense21, defense22) %>%\n  mutate(TeamSeason = paste(Tm, Season)) %>%\n  mutate(\n    PPG = PA/G,\n    YPG = TotalYds/G\n    ) %>%\n  filter(Rk > 0)\n\nqb20 <- read_csv(\"2020NFLDefensiveStats.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2020)\nqb21 <- read_csv(\"2021NFLDefensiveStats.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2021)\nqb22 <- read_csv(\"2022DefensiveStats.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2022)\n\nvikes <- defense %>% filter(Tm == \"Minnesota Vikings\")\nchiefs <- defense %>% filter(Tm == \"Kansas City Chiefs\")\nrams <- defense %>% filter(Tm == \"Los Angeles Rams\")\nbucs <- defense %>% filter(Tm == \"Tampa Bay Buccaneers\")\ntexans <- defense %>% filter(Tm == \"Houston Texans\")\nlions <- defense %>% filter(Tm == \"Detroit Lions\")\npanthers <- defense %>% filter(Tm == \"Carolina Panthers\")\n\neight <- defense %>% filter(Tm == \"Minnesota Vikings\" | Tm == \"Kansas City Chiefs\" | Tm == \"Los Angeles Rams\" | Tm == \"Tampa Bay Buccaneers\" | Tm == \"Houston Texans\" | Tm == \"Detroit Lions\" | Tm == \"Carolina Panthers\")\n\nfive <- defense %>% filter(TeamSeason == \"Minnesota Vikings 2022\" | TeamSeason == \"Kansas City Chiefs 2022\" | TeamSeason == \"Los Angeles Rams 2021\" | TeamSeason == \"Tampa Bay Buccaneers 2020\" | TeamSeason == \"Detroit Lions 2021\")\n\nqb2020 <- read_csv(\"2020QBStats.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2020, PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season))\nqb2021 <- read_csv(\"2021QBStats.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2021, PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season))\nqb2022 <- read_csv(\"qbstats22.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2022, PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season))\n\nqb <- bind_rows(qb2020, qb2021, qb2022) \n\nqbstats <- read_csv(\"TDStats.csv\")\n\nstarters <- qb %>% \n  filter(Pos == \"QB\", GS > 12)\n\nkirk <- starters %>% \n  filter(Player == \"Kirk Cousins\")\n\ntopQb <- starters %>%\n  group_by(Player) %>%\nsummarise(\n  AverageQBR = mean(QBR),\n  AverageCmp = mean(`Cmp%`)\n  )  %>% \nungroup() %>%\ntop_n(25)\n\nkirk2 <- topQb %>% \nfilter(Player == \"Kirk Cousins\")\n\npat <- topQb %>% \nfilter(Player == \"Patrick Mahomes\")\n\narod <- topQb %>% \nfilter(Player == \"Aaron Rodgers\")\n\njosh <- topQb %>% \nfilter(Player == \"Josh Allen\")\n\nelite <- topQb %>% \nfilter(Player == \"Joe Burrow\" | Player == \"Justin Herbert\" | Player == \"Tom Brady\")\n\njustin <- topQb %>% \nfilter(Player == \"Justin Herbert\")\n\njoe <- topQb %>% \nfilter(Player == \"Joe Burrow\")\n\ntom <- topQb %>% \nfilter(Player == \"Tom Brady\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=qbstats,\n    aes(y=reorder(NAME, TD), x=TD, xend=INT),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\"\n    ) +\n  labs(\n    title=\"The further the QB's green dot is from his red dot the better he is\",\n    subtitle=\"For all the blame Kirk Cousins gets it, it seems he doesn't get enough credit,\\nFor how good his play is on the offensive end\",\n    x=\"Name\",\n    y=\"TD to INT ratio\",\n    caption=\"Source: StatMuse | Graphic by Nick Evans\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 7),\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next graph I put together looks at completion percentage and QBR. QBR is the holy grail statistic people look at for quarterbacks as it’s basically a grade on their whole season. When looking at this graph Cousins falls from the elite quarterbacks even into the below average section. As a Cousins and Vikings fan this one hurts to see but it isn’t very surprising. As a fan I have watched Cousins for all five of his seasons and I do believe he is one of the top ten quarterbacks in the league, but I have always known he’s not elite. This isn’t anything against Cousins, but he just doesn’t have the talent the other quarterbacks do. The next chart will show that Kirk Cousins may deserve some criticism, but he gets an unfair amount of criticism for some things he can’t control such as playing defense.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data=topQb, aes(x=AverageQBR, y=AverageCmp),\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=kirk2, aes(x=AverageQBR, y=AverageCmp), color=\"purple\"\n  ) +\n   geom_point(\n    data=pat, aes(x=AverageQBR, y=AverageCmp), color=\"red\"\n  ) +\n   geom_point(\n    data=josh, aes(x=AverageQBR, y=AverageCmp), color=\"blue\"\n   ) +\n   geom_point(\n    data=arod, aes(x=AverageQBR, y=AverageCmp), color=\"darkgreen\"\n   ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=justin, aes(x=AverageQBR, y=AverageCmp), color=\"lightblue\"\n   ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=joe, aes(x=AverageQBR, y=AverageCmp), color=\"orange\"\n   ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=tom, aes(x=AverageQBR, y=AverageCmp), color=\"darkred\"\n   ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 56.006) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 66.98) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=kirk2,\n    aes(x=AverageQBR, y=AverageCmp, label=Player)\n  ) +\n   geom_text_repel(\n    data=pat,\n    aes(x=AverageQBR, y=AverageCmp, label=Player)\n   ) +\n   geom_text_repel(\n    data=josh,\n    aes(x=AverageQBR, y=AverageCmp, label=Player)\n   ) +\n   geom_text_repel(\n    data=arod,\n    aes(x=AverageQBR, y=AverageCmp, label=Player)\n   ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=elite,\n    aes(x=AverageQBR, y=AverageCmp, label=Player)\n   ) +\n    labs(\n    title=\"Kirk Cousins can't keep up with the Elite QBs\",\n    subtitle=\"The Vikings QB has the pretty stats but when it comes to the most important statistic he is a little below\\n average\",\n    x=\"Average Quarterback Rating\",\n    y=\"Completion Percentage\",\n    caption=\"Source: Pro-Football Reference | Graphic by Nick Evans\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 7),\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows the total yards allowed and points allowed the last three years for the Vikings defense. As you can see, they suck and are some of the worst defenses in the league. For reference I put the past three Superbowl winners in this graph and as you can see, they are in the bottom left corner which means they were very good. Good enough in fact to win the Superbowl. Then to give more reference on how bad the defense has been that light blue dot is the Detroit Lions 2021 defense. Their record that year, 3-13. Our defense this year is right next to that dot and what was our record, 13-4. I think the defense ruined Kirk Cousins best year in purple and he should get credit for how far he took this team. The defense has been the problem in Minnesota for the last three years not Cousins.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=defense, aes(x=YPG, y=PPG), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=vikes, aes(x=YPG, y=PPG), color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_point(data=five, aes(x=YPG, y=PPG), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=five, aes(x=YPG, y=PPG), color=\"maroon\") +\n  geom_point(data=five, aes(x=YPG, y=PPG), color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_encircle(data=vikes, aes(x=YPG, y=PPG), s_shape=.1, expand=.01, color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=five, aes(x=YPG, y=PPG, label=Tm,)) +\n  labs(title=\"The Vikings defense has been bad, really bad.\", subtitle=\"The past three superbowl champions have had great defenses yet the Vikings defense is terrible.\\nIn 2022 the Vikings went 13-4, However,in 2021 the Lions went 3-13 with almost the same defense.\", x=\"Yards Per Game\", y=\"Point Per Game\", caption=\"Source: Pro-Football Reference | Graphic by Nick Evans\") +\n    theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 7),\n  ) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 23) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=347) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 7),\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion do I believe it’s time to move on from Cousins, for the right price yes otherwise no. I think unless we make a big jump in the draft boards, we will not be able to replace Cousins talent and I much rather stick with him then reach on a rookie quarterback who is a project. If we could get draft capital and move up in the draft boards then I would be in. That will not happen though, and I can’t get behind the idea of being garbage for the next three years to get one of those top draft picks. I would keep Kirk two more years and try to go all in and if it fails then let’s be garbage."

    "text": "The NBA regular season no longer translates to the postseason. This year four of the top seven best records in the league lost in the first round this year. You would think winning 58 games like the Milwaukee Bucks did would result in a championship or at least an appearance. Well, that would be wrong as the 8th seed Miami Heat beat them in five games which is unheard of in the past NBA. In fact, it is so unheard of that the Milwaukee Bucks odds to win this series were -1200 and that was the 4th largest odds to be favored ever and lose the series. There are many reasons for why the NBA regular season is different than it ever has been and why nothing you do in the regular season guarantees success. Two of the main reasons are load management to prevent health and how the league is so more three oriented than it ever was before. This leads to volatile shooting nights that result in unpredictable results. If a team is hitting their threes for a four-game stretch that they never usually do that team can win the series even if they aren’t the better team. With all this being said let’s look at the final eight teams and see who has the best shot at a title.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\n\npergame <- read_csv(\"nbapergame23.csv\")\n\nnba <- read_csv(\"nbaadvanced23.csv\") %>% \n  filter(Team !=\"League Average\")\n\nplayoff <- nba %>% \n  filter(Team == \"Los Angeles Lakers\" | Team == \"Los Angeles Clippers\" | Team == \"Milwaukee Bucks\" | Team == \"Boston Celtics\" | Team == \"Philadelphia 76ers\" | Team == \"Golden State Warriors\" | Team == \"Phoenix Suns\" | Team == \"Minnesota Timberwolves\" | Team == \"Memphis Grizzlies\" | Team == \"Denver Nuggets\" | Team == \"Sacramento Kings\" | Team == \"Cleveland Cavaliers\" | Team == \"New York Knicks\" | Team == \"Miami Heat\" | Team == \"Atlanta Hawks\" | Team == \"Brooklyn Nets\") \n\nlasteight <- nba %>% \nfilter(Team == \"Los Angeles Lakers\" | Team == \"Boston Celtics\" | Team == \"Philadelphia 76ers\" | Team == \"Golden State Warriors\" | Team == \"Phoenix Suns\" | Team == \"Denver Nuggets\" | Team == \"New York Knicks\" | Team == \"Miami Heat\")\n\nlakers <- nba %>% \n  filter(Team == \"Los Angeles Lakers\")\n\nceltics <- nba %>% \n  filter(Team == \"Boston Celtics\")\n\nsixers <- nba %>% \n  filter(Team == \"Philadelphia 76ers\")\n\nnuggets <- nba %>% \n  filter(Team == \"Denver Nuggets\")\n\nwarriors <- nba %>% \n  filter(Team == \"Golden State Warriors\")\n\nsuns <- nba %>% \n  filter(Team == \"Phoenix Suns\")\n\nknicks <- nba %>% \n  filter(Team == \"New York Knicks\")\n\nheat <- nba %>% \n  filter(Team == \"Miami Heat\")\n\nbucks <- nba %>% \n  filter(Team == \"Milwaukee Bucks\")\n\nnba %>% \n    select(Team, W, L) %>% \n  mutate(Order=W) %>% \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=c(-\"Team\",-\"Order\"),\n    names_to=\"Result\",\n    values_to=\"Total\"\n  ) -> nbawl\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(\n    data=nbawl,\n    aes(x=reorder(Team, Order), weight=Total, fill=Result)\n  ) +\n  coord_flip() + \n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"blue\", \"red\")) +\nlabs(\n    title=\"The NBA regular season doesn't mean as much as it once did\",\n    subtitle=\"Four of the top seven records in the NBA all went home in the 1st round.\",\n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"\",\n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | Graphic by Nick Evans\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 7),\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at offensive and defensive ratings for the whole season three to four teams catch my eye. The New York Knicks have the best defensive rating left in the playoffs while also having one of the more efficient offenses in the league, congrats New York. What I see next is the Philadelphia 76ers, Boston Celtics and Denver Nuggets have some of best offenses in the league but lack slightly with their defensive play, but they aren’t bad except the Celtics. This chart did show me some things about these teams that I didn’t know before but let’s really say what will happen. The Knicks are a five seed and should be happy getting to the eastern conference finals but most likely will lose before then. The Celtics defense appears to be one of the worst in the league and it will lose them a series before getting to the finals. Then there is two teams left, the Nuggets and the 76ers as real contenders.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=playoff, aes(x=ORtg, y=DRtg), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=lakers, aes(x=ORtg, y=DRtg), color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_point(data=celtics, aes(x=ORtg, y=DRtg), color=\"darkgreen\") +\n  geom_point(data=warriors, aes(x=ORtg, y=DRtg), color=\"gold\") +\n  geom_point(data=knicks, aes(x=ORtg, y=DRtg), color=\"orange\") +\n  geom_point(data=nuggets, aes(x=ORtg, y=DRtg), color=\"navyblue\") +\n  geom_point(data=suns, aes(x=ORtg, y=DRtg), color=\"#E56020\") +\n  geom_point(data=sixers, aes(x=ORtg, y=DRtg), color=\"#ED174C\") +\n  geom_point(data=heat, aes(x=ORtg, y=DRtg), color=\"#98002E\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=lasteight, aes(x=ORtg, y=DRtg, label=Team)) + \n  geom_text(aes(x=114, y=112, label=\"Below average offense\\n and defense\"), size=3, color=\"lightblue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=116, y=112, label=\"Above average offense\\n and bad defense\"), size=3, color=\"lightblue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=116, y=116, label=\"Above average offense\\n and good defense\"), size=3, color=\"lightblue\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=114.8) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=114.8) +\n    labs(\n    title=\"According to the data, the Knicks are the best team left\",\n    subtitle=\"The Knicks, 76ers and Nuggets standout the most when it comes to offensive rating and defensive rating.\",\n    x=\"Offensive Rating\",\n    y=\"Defensive Rating\",\n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | Graphic by Nick Evans\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 7),\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve been saying it throughout this whole article that the NBA is different than it was and what do you need to do to win an NBA game today? Make threes and get to the line. Looking at the 76ers they are one of the best teams in the league at both shooting 39% from three this season while also getting to the line 25 times a game. The Nuggets shoot 38% from three and they also add 22 free throw attempts a game. If these two teams can keep this pace up the rest of the playoffs, I believe they both have a good shot at making the finals. I’m not a betting man but if I was, I believe I would bet the Nuggets to win the NBA Finals.\n\n\nCode\ntopeight <- pergame %>% \n  filter(Team == \"Los Angeles Lakers\" | Team == \"Boston Celtics\" | Team == \"Philadelphia 76ers\" | Team == \"Golden State Warriors\" | Team == \"Phoenix Suns\" | Team == \"Denver Nuggets\" | Team == \"New York Knicks\" | Team == \"Miami Heat\")\n\ntopeight %>% \n  select(Team, `3P%`, FTA, `FT%`) %>%\n  arrange(desc(FTA)) %>% \n  gt()%>% \n  cols_label(\n    `3P%` = \"3 Pt. %\",\n    FTA = \"Free Throw Att\",\n    `FT%` = \"Free Throw %\"\n  ) %>%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"The NBA is a high scoring league today.
